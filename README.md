# Azure.ApplicationInsight.Xamarin
Azure Application Insights bindings and demo for Xamarin iOS

This repository/bindings are based on the sample provided by Microsoft [here] (https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Xamarin). 
That sample is using Xamarin.Forms, so you could use the bindings that I provide here if you are using Xamarin.iOS. 
You could update the bindings accordingly if you are using Xamarin.Android.
